# Exercise 1: Variable Names
Name            Classification    Reason
index           Idiomatic         (I thought it was an illegal reserved word)           
CatName         Non-idiomatic     Pascal Case should be used for class names only
lazy_dog        Idiomatic
quick_Fox       Non-idiomatic     All alphabetical characters should be lower Case
1stCharacter    Illegal (I thought it was non-idiomatic)    Variable name should not start with a number
operand2        Idiomatic         (I thought there should be an underscore between the d and the 2)
BIG_NUMBER      Non-idiomatic     All caps (screaming snake case) should only be used for constant names
Pi symbol       Non-idiomatic     Pi is not an ASCII character 
                                  (I got this wrong. I new it wasn't a good variable name but I didn't know why)

# Exercise 2: Function Names
Same answers as in exercise 1, as function names follow the same conventions as variable names in Python

# Exercise 3: Constant Names
index           Non-idiomatic       Should be all upper case
CatName         Non-idiomatic       Should be all upper case
snake_case      Non-idiomatic       Should be all upper case
LAZY_DOG3       Idiomatic
1ST             Illegal             Should not start with a digit
operand2        Non-idiomatic       Should be all upper case
BIG_NUMBER      Idiomatic
Symbol that looks like a square 'n' Non-idiomatic   Not an ASCII character

# Exercise 4: Class Names
index           Non-idiomatic       Needs to start with upper case
CatName         Idiomatic
Lazy_Dog        Non-idiomatic       Should not have an underscore between them
1ST             Illegal             Should not start with a digit
operand2        Non-idiomatic       Should start with a capital letter

Square 'n' and i Non-idiomatic      Square 'n' is not an ASCII character

# Exercise 7
Victor is greeted 3 times, then Nina is greeted 3 times because the
string constant NAME was reassigned from Victor to Nina. Constants
are not meant to be changed, but this is not enforced in Python.

# Exercises 8 and 9 are in balance.Python

# Exercise 10
obj = 42
# Question          Action on variable (reassign, mutate or do neither)?
obj = 'ABcd'        Reassignment (correct)
obj.upper()         Neither (I wasn't sure)
obj = obj.lower()   Reassignment (I got it wrong)
print(len(obj))     Neither. Just prints the property of an object. Doesn't change it
obj = list(obj)     Reassignment (I got this wrong)
obj.pop()           Mutation
obj[2] = 'X'        Mutation
obj.sort()          Mutation
set(obj)            Neither. The object hasn't changed
obj = tuple(obj)    Reassignment
