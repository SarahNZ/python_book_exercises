# Question 1
print('Sarah' + ' ' + 'Stenfert')

# Question 2
>>> number = 4936

# Ones Place Value
>>> ones = number % 10
>>> print(ones)
6

# Tens Place Value
>>> number = number // 10
>>> print(number)
493

>>> tens = number % 10
>>> print(tens)
3

# Hundreds Place Value
>>> number = number // 10
>>> print(number)
hundreds = number % 10
>> print(hundreds)
9

# Thousands Place Value
>>> thousands = number // 10
>>> print(thousands)
4

# Question 3
>>> print('5' + '10')
Outputs 510 because the print function treats the numbers as strings, so 
concatenates the string characters rather than adding them as an arithmetic
operation

# Question 4
>>> print(int('5') + int('10'))
15

# Question 5
Yes, an index (out of range) error will occur, as there is no item at index 3 in the list foo

# Question 6
>>> 'foo' == 'Foo'
False, as the two strings are not the same

# Question 7
>>> int('3.1415')
Raises a value error as the string is not a valid integer (whole number)

# Question 8
>>> '12' < '9'
True, as the strings will be compared character by character starting on the 
left. 1 is smaller than 9.
